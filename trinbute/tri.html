    <p class="p">
        As Kevin grew from a teenager to a young man, so too did his knowledge of phones, computers, and programming, as well as his bravado to gain unauthorized access to the sensitive information they stored. By the late ’80s and throughout the early ’90s,
        Kevin landed himself at the top of the FBI’s Most Wanted list for hacking into dozens of major corporations, just to see if he could. But contrary to the dark, low-brow cybercriminal the media and law enforcement portrayed him as, Kevin’s breaches
        were never meant for financial gain or harm. They were always about the adventure, the adrenaline rush. Kevin was and still is a “trophy hunter”: a pursuer of big, shiny prizes, merely to prove he can win. And let’s not forget the sheer humor
        of outwitting all-things-establishment or arrogant tech-heads. But unauthorized access is still unauthorized access regardless of ill-will. For three years, Kevin went on the run, using false identities and fleeing from city to city to resist
        arrest until cornered in a final showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down. In 1995, he was finally forced to serve five years of hard time by those who feared the extent of his digital power. </p>
